# Monte Carlo Methods in Finance

This project explores the application of Monte Carlo simulations in financial modeling. It includes implementations and visualizations of Brownian Motion, Geometric Brownian Motion, and interest rate models using Python.

## Contents

- `01_brownian_motion.ipynb`: Simulation and analysis of standard Brownian motion  
- `02_geometric_brownian_motion.ipynb`: Comparison of two GBM discretization schemes  
- `03_interest_rate_model.ipynb`: Monte Carlo simulation of interest rate processes  
- `src/bm_simulations.py`: Python implementation for Brownian motion  
- `src/gbm_simulations.py`: Python implementation for GBM  
- `src/interest_rate_model.py`: Interest rate model code
